# Test Item Analyzer

A modern web application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS that helps educators, test developers, and psychometricians evaluate the quality of test questions. By simply entering response data, you can instantly compute two key metrics: difficulty percentage (p-value) and discrimination index.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 Difficulty Percentage (p-value)  
  Calculate the proportion of test-takers who answered a question correctly. Values range from 0.0 (extremely hard) to 1.0 (very easy).

- ⚡ Instant Calculation  
  Input your item response data (e.g., correct/incorrect per student, total scores) and get immediate results – no page reload required.

- 📱 Responsive Design  
  Clean, mobile-friendly interface built with Tailwind CSS.

- 🧪 Type-Safe  
  Written in TypeScript for robust, maintainable code.
